# Annotation Pipeline for BT&S 

This repository will make up the evidence for the Bioinformatics Software and Tools module
of the ARU/Sanger BSc Bioinformatics Year 2 Course.

### Installation of pipeline
This can be acheived through the use of:

`conda create --file environment.yml`

However this can take quite some time and personally was faster
installing it all seperately.

### Data
Sample Data comes from the Utah family platinum read set.
